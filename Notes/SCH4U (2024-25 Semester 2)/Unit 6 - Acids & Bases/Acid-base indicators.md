Acid base indicators are substances that when present in a solution with a given pH, will either have a specific color or be colorless. Many different indicators have different pH ranges in which they change color and different colors.

Litmus paper in particular will be red if pH of the solution it is in is <4.5 and will turn blue if pH is >8.3.

Indicators at their core are just weak acids or bases that have distinct color differences with their conjugate base or conjugate acid.

When \[H$_3$O] is increased, and therefore pH is increased, the reaction shifts to the reactants side and more of HIn will be produce, along with its color getting stronger. If a base is added and as it neutralizes the H$_3$O its concentration decreases, reaction will shift to the product side and more In$^-$ will be produced, along with its color.

The point at which an indicator changes color the fastest is called the transition point/end point. At this point, \[HIn] = \[In$^-$]

### Indicator applications in titration

When titrating a acid and a base, indicators are used to predict the stoichiometry point/equivalence point (when pH = 7 or when \[H$^+$] = \[OH$^-$])
