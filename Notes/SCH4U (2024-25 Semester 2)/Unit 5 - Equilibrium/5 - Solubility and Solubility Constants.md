When a substance is not soluble in water, there is an equilibrium between the solute and the aqueous ions. The numerical equilibrium constant is called K$_{sp}$. Solubility is represented in mol/L and represents the amount of moles that can dissolve in one liter of a solvent. A solute is considered “soluble” if the solubility is greater than 0.1 mol/L

K$_{sp}$ is the product of the aqueous ions of a solute. The solute itself is not included in the expression because it’s “concentration” does not change.

### Interpreting K$_{sp}$

Like all equilibrium constants, a high K$_{sp}$ value of a solute means that it is more soluble and a low K$_{sp}$ Value means it is less soluble. 

When looking at the values of K$_{sp}$ of the products of a double displacement reaction, it can tell you whether a particular product is a solid precipitate or not

 If Q can be calculated, it can be compared to K$_{sp}$ to figure out whether the substance will dissolve:

- If Q > K$_{sp}$, precipitate will form
- If Q < K$_{sp}$, more solute can dissolve
- If Q = K$_{sp}$, system will be at equilibrium
