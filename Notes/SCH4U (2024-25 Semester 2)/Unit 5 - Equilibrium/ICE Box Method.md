To find the equilibrium concentrations of the various species in an equilibrium system given initial concentrations, the ICE box method is used.

The letters in ICE stand for:

**I - Initial
C - Change
E - Equilibrium**

### I - Intial

The I in ICE represents the initial concentrations of the species given in a question. 

### C - Change

The C in ICE represents the change in concentration of each species from initial to final. This change is usually what we are trying to find, and is denoted x. 

The side of the reaction that is thermodynamically favoured has a +x for change while the side that isn't has a -x. If the species has a coefficient, x will be multiplied by that coefficient.

### E - Equilibrium

The E in ICE represents the final equilibrium concentrations of each species. The formula for those concentrations is: $$Initial + Change$$Since change is represented as x, the equilibrium concentrations will be expressed as values in relation to x.
