Equilibrium constant expressions can show numerically the magnitude in which an equilibrium system favours the reactant or product side. Base expression is in the format of $\frac{products}{reactants}$ (at equilibrium) with each species raised to the power of its coefficient. Since products are on the numerator, a reaction that has a high relative concentration of products (and therefore favours the product side) will have a high K$_{eq}$ value while a low K$_{eq}$ value means the system favours the reactant side

Usually, specialized equilibrium constants (Ex. K$_a$, K$_b$, K$_{sp}$) are experimentally found and shown in a chart for various substances.

Some rules to consider:
1. **Pure liquids are not included in expression**
$\qquad$In reactions where there is one liquid involved, the liquid is omitted from the K value calculation (since liquids can’t have a “concentration” aside from density)

2. **Solids are not included in expression**
$\qquad$Anytime a solid is present in a reaction, it is also omitted from the K value calculation as long as density doesn’t change

3. **Catalyst, concentration, volume, and pressure changes do not change K$_{eq}$, but only changes in temperature**
$\qquad$All these changes will affect the individual concentrations of the products and reactants but will not change the ratio between them, and since K$_{eq}$ concerns the ratio of products over reactants, K$_{eq}$ does not change (except changes in temperature, which do change the ratio of products vs reactants)

4. **When coefficients are multiplied by a factor, K$_{eq}$ gets an exponent of that factor**
$\qquad$Since the coefficients of the reactants and products are related to their powers in the equilibrium expression, changing the coefficients changes the powers on each term of the equilibrium expression

5. **When reversing a reaction, K$_{eq}$ becomes its reciprocal**

##### K$_c$ - Equilibrium expression for concentration
For most reactions with aqueous solutions and/or gasses present, K$_c$ expression is used:

##### K$_p$ - Equilibrium expression for gasses
For reactions with only gasses, partial pressures can be used:

The relationship between K$_c$ and K$_p$ is defined in this equation:

Where:

R is the universal gas constant 0.0821L $\cdot$ atm/mol $\cdot$ K
T is the temperature **in Kelvin**
$\Delta$n is the sum of coefficients of products - sum of coefficients of reactants
