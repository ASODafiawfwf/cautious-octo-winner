### K$_{eq}$ calculations

K$_{eq}$ can be calculated by using the ICE box method on a reaction given enough information. Inversely, the ICE box can be filled out by solving for x using a given K$_{eq}$.

There are many scenarios where K$_{sp}$ can be used to solve for x:

1. **Perfect square method**

When the equilibrium expression has the same exponent on the numerator and the denominator, a root can be taken to reduce the degree of x and making solving easier

2. **Assumption method**

When K$_{eq}$ << 1, we can assume that x is negligible (since x is the change and a small K$_{eq}$ means reaction doesn’t progress as much).

3. **Quadratic method**

When all other methods don’t work, x has to be found using quadratic formula.
