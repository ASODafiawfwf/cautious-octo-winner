The reaction quotient, Q (or K$_{trial}$), is the calculation of the ratio of the concentrations of the products vs reactants at any point in an equilibrium reaction (doesnâ€™t have to be calculated at equilibrium like K$_{eq}$).
### Interpreting Q

A system that is not in equilibrium will always change to reach the equilibrium state. If Q > K$_{eq}$, it means there is a higher relative concentration of products than the equilibrium state, meaning the system will shift to the reactants. Inversely, if Q <  K$_{eq}$, there is a higher relative concentration of reactants than the equilibrium state, meaning the system will shift to the products. If Q = K$_{eq}$, system is at equilibrium and there will be no shift in reaction.

In the ICE box method, the side that will get the positive change can be taken if enough information is given to calculate Q and K$_{eq}$.
