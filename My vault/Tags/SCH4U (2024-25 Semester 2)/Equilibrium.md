Equilibrium is the state of a system (closed) in which a forward reaction and a backward reaction are equal in rate. This means there is no observable macroscopic changes in the system.

Equilibrium is a calculation heavy unit. As a basic premise, all equilibrium-related calculations use an equilibrium constant or the [[3 - ICE Box Method|ICE box method]] method to quantitatively analyze the members in an equilibrium system. Other conceptual problems can include the usage of [[1 - Le Chatelier’s Principle|Le Chatelier’s Principle]] and related graphical expressions of equilibrium systems.
