### Historical theories of the atom

1. **Democritus**
- All matter is made of invisible and indivisible particles (atomos)

2. **Aristotle**
- Believed all matter was composed of 4 elements: fire, water, earth, and air
- Rejected Democritus’ theory

3. **John Dalton**
- All matter consists of indivisible particles (like billiard balls that can interact physically with each other)
- Different elements are made up of different types of these “atoms”
- Compounds are formed by combining specific ratios of atoms

4. **William Crookes**
- Developed the cathode ray tube
	- Consisted of a ray of negatively charged particles being shot at a detector
- Led to J. J. Thomson’s experiments

5. **J. J. Thomson**
- Discovered there is a positively charge subatomic particle called the proton
- Proposed the “plum pudding” model
	- Negatively charged electrons are scattered around an area of positive charge

6. **Robert Millikan**
- Calculated the exact charge and mass of an electron

7. **Ernest Rutherford**
- Conducted the gold foil experiment
