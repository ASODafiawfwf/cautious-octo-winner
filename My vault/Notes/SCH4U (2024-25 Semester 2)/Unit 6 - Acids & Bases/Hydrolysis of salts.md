$\quad$Hydrolysis is a reaction where the ion components of a salt react with water to form acidic or basic solutions.

##### Cation hydrolysis

Six positive ions that can undergo hydrolysis:

- Al(H$_2$O)$_6$$^{3+}$ (Hexaaquaaluminum (iii))
- Fe(H$_2$O)$_6$$^{3+}$ (Hexaaquairon (iii))
- Cr(H$_2$O)$_6$$^{3+}$ (Hexaaquachromium (iii))
- NH$_4$$^+$ (Ammonium)
- Sn(H$_2$O)$_4$$^{2+}$ (Tetraaquatin (ii))
- Cu(H$_2$O)$_4$$^{2+}$ (Tetraaquacopper (ii))

==All other cations **cannot** undergo hydrolysis

Cations that can hydrolyze to create acidic solutions by giving a proton away to a water molecule.

##### Anion hydrolysis

Six negative ions that **cannot** undergo hydrolysis:

- Cl$^-$ (Chloride ion)
- Br$^-$ (Bromide ion)
- I$^-$ (Iodide ion)
- ClO$_4$$^-$ (Perchlorate ion)
- NO$_3$$^-$ (Nitrate ion)
- HSO$_4$$^-$ (Bisulfate ion)

==All other anions **can** undergo hydrolysis==

Anions that can hydrolyze to create basic solutions by taking a proton from a water molecules.

### Special cases

1. **Both ions of a salt cannot hydrolyze**
Solution will remain neutral

Ex. MgCl$_2$

Mg$^{2+}$ cannot be hydrolyzed because it is not one of the six cations that can be hydrolyzed
Cl$^-$ cannot be hydrolyzed because it is one of the six anions that can’t be hydrolyzed

Therefore, there is no change in the pH of the solution

2. **Both ions of a salt can hydrolyze**
Solution will be acidic or alkaline depending on if the base is a stronger base or the acid is a stronger acid

Ex. Al$_2$(CO$_3$)$_3$

Al$^{3+}$ can be hydrolyzed because it is one of the six cations that can be hydrolyzed. It will make the solution acidic
CO$_3$ can also be hydrolyzed because it is not one of the six anions that cannot be hydrolyzed. It will make the solution basic

Since the two ions oppose each other in making the solution either basic or acidic, Ka of the acid and Kb of the base must be taken into account

The reactions for the two ion’s hydrolyzation in water (Al(H$_2$O)$_6$$^{3+}$ being the acid and CO$_3$$^{-2}$ being the base) Is:

For the base(in this case it’s CO$_3$$^{-2}$, Kb would have to be calculated from the Ka of HCO$_3$$^-$

Kb (of CO$_3$$^{-2}$ in this case) is 1.7 $\times$ 10$^{-4}$
Ka (of Al(H$_2$O)$_6$$^{3+}$ is this case) is 1.3 $\times$ 10$^{-5}$

If Kb > Ka, solution is basic. if Ka > Kb, solution is acidic

Since Kb is bigger in this scenario, the hydrolyzation of the two ions would result in the net change in pH causing the solution to be basic.

3. **Amphoteric compounds**
For a compound that can act as both an acid and a base, whether the hydrolyzation reaction creates an acidic or basic solution depends on the Ka/Kb values of the possible reactions.

Ex. HSO$_3$$^-$

Two possible hydrolyzation reactions for this ion is:

In this case, we would have to look at both the Ka and the Kb values for HSO$_3$$^-$ (Kb would be acquired b converting the Ka of H$_2$SO$_3$ into Kb)

Ka of HSO$_3$$^-$ is 1.0 $\times$ 10$^{-7}$
Kb of HSO$_3$$^-$ is 6.7 $\times$ 10$^{-13}$

If Kb > Ka, solution is basic and ion hydrolysis into conjugate acid. If Ka > Kb, solution is acidic and ion hydrolyzes into conjugate base.

Since Ka is bigger than Ka in this scenario, the hydrolyzation of HSO$_3$$^-$ would result in an acidic solution and HSO$_3$$^-$ would hydrolyze into SO$_3$$^{-2}$
