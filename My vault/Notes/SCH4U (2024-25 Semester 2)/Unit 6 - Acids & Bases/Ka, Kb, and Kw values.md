K$_w$ is the equilibrium constant for the auto-ionization reaction of water

At 25$\degree$C, this value is 1.0 $\times$ 10$^{-14}$ .

==Derivation:==

Water at 25$\degree$C has a pH of 7, meaning the \[H$_3$O$^+$] of water is 1.0 $\times$ 10$^{-7}$. Since \[H$_3$O$^+$] = \[OH$^-$], K$_w$ would be (1.0 $\times$ 10$^{-7}$)$^2$, which is 1.0 $\times$ 10$^{-14}$.

### K$_a$ and K$_b$

K$_a$ and K$_b$ determines the relative strengths of acids and bases. Strong acids and bases have high K$_a$ and K$_b$ values and weak acids and bases have low K$_a$ and K$_b$ values.
