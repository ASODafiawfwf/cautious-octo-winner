“If a closed system at equilibrium is subjected to a change (a stress), the system will respond so as to counteract that change (I.e. will try to reduce the stress)” - Ms. Kim’s handout definition of Le Chatelier’s Principle

- Equilibrium system will always return back to an equilibrium state once disturbed
	- Equilibrium will **not** return to the original state

##### Potential stressors of equilibrium system

1. **Concentration changes (for solutions)**
	- When concentration of one species is increased, reaction favours the opposite side of the reaction from the species
	- When concentration of one species decreased, reaction favours the side of the reaction that the species is in
	-  All concentrations of species that are on the same side increase or decrease together

2. **Pressure changes (for gasses)**
	- If pressure is increased, reaction favours side with less moles
	- If pressure is decreased, reaction favours side with more moles
	- ==The system will try its best to return pressure to it’s original value==

3. **Temperature changes**
	- If temperature increased, the side opposite to the side where heat is is favoured
	- If temperature is decreased, side where heat is is favoured
	- ==Like pressure, system will try to return temperature to original by favouring exothermic or endothermic aspects of reaction==
