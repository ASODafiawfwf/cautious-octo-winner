To find the equilibrium concentrations of the various species in a reaction, the ICE box method is used.

The letters in ICE stand for:

**I - Initial
C - Change
E - Equilibrium (concentrations)**

For a given reaction, various concentration are given for the initial row (if the concentrations of species in only one side is given, assume the other sideâ€™s concentrations are 0M). Change is usually +/- x (depending whether the species is on the side of the reaction that is favoured or not) multiplied by the coefficient of the species. Equilibrium is Initial +/- Change.

In this case, reaction goes towards the product side since we start with no product.
