For each reaction, determine the direction of enthalpy drive and the direction of the entropy drive. Then determine which one factor is responsible for the **forward** reaction.

1. Heat + N2O3 (g) ⇌ NO (g) + NO2 (g)
- Starts with one mole and ends with two (ΔS is + and favours products)
- **Heat is used in the reaction (ΔH is - and favours reactants) (drives forward reaction)**

2. 2H2 (g) + 2NO (g) ⇌ N2 (g) + 2H2O (g) + Heat
- **Starts with four moles and ends with three (ΔS is - and favours reactants) (drives forward reaction)**
- Heat is released in the reaction (ΔH is + and favours products)

3. CO (g) + 1/2O2 (g) ⇌ CO2 (g) ; ΔH = -283 kJ
- Starts with 3.5 moles and ends with one mole (ΔS is - and favours products)
- **ΔH is - and favours reactants (drives forward reaction)**

4. I2 (g) + Cl2(g) ⇌ 2ICl (g) ; ΔH = 35 kJ
- Starts with two moles and ends with two moles (No ΔS)
- ΔH is + and favours products

==No noticeable driver for reactants, reaction will not go to completion==

5. H2O (l) ⇌ H2O (g) ; ΔH = 41 kJ
- **Starts with one mole and ends with one mole (ΔS is + and favours reactants) (drives forward reaction)**
- ΔH is + and favours products
